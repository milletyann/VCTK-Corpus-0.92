1: Audio files recorded via DPA 4035 (mic1) have very low frequency noises and therefore we added audio files recorded via MKH 800 (mic2)     

2: We changed the waveform format from the PCM to the lossless Flac format in order to reduce the database size. For changing Flac encoded audio files back to PCM, please use sox. 
% sox input.flac output.wav

3: For converting original recording files at 96kHz/24 bit to 48kHz/16 bit, we used dithering. Therefore audio files of mic1 are not identical to those of previous version, either.  
sox $argv[1] -G -c 1 -b 16 $argv[2] remix 1 rate -v -s 48000 dither -s
sox $argv[1] -G -c 1 -b 16 $argv[3] remix 2 rate -v -s 48000 dither -s  

4: Delete txt/p247/p274_470.txt

5: Delete wav48/p326/p326_365.wav

6: Delete p351/p351_361, p306/p306_151, p295/p295_001, p300/p300_155, p306/p306_352, p254/p254_368, p232/232_212, p282/p282_116, and p277/p277_388
